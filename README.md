# What is Huffman Coding
A Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding and/or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding algorithm which derives the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence (weight) for each possible value of the source symbol.
